### What I learned

This project helped me to enhance my skills in using Flexbox and CSS custom properties to create a responsive and visually appealing layout. Specifically, I learned how to:

-   Implement a clean and flexible card design using Flexbox.
-   Utilize custom properties in CSS to maintain consistency and simplify style adjustments.
-   Create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

Here’s an example of CSS code I’m proud of:

```css
#card {
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: column;
	align-items: flex-start;
	gap: 1rem;
	width: 22.5rem;
	padding: 1.5rem;
	border-radius: 1rem;
	background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
	color: hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
}
```
